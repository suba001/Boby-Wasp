# Boby-Wasp
(Not Finished)

Hello !

Today, I put on my GitHub's account a little game who looks like flappy bird. At the begining, I wanted to create another game. But I finnaly created this game. In my game you are a wasp and you fly between pillars. It goes more and more speed ! I didn't make the hit boxes for the moment, but I will probably publish another best version in the next days.
For make my games, I use Windows 10 and sometimes Linux, I work with python v : 3.9.5 and pygame v : 2.0.1. Do not hesitate to upload my code and try to start it, and, see you later !
